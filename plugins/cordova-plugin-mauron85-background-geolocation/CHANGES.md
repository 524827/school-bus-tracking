Since alpha.29:
- Android show service notification only when in background
- Android remove config option startForeground (related to above)

Since alpha.32:
- Android bring back startForeground config option (BREAKING CHANGE!)

startForeground has slightly different meaning.

If false (default) then service will create notification and promotes
itself to foreground service, when client unbinds from service.
This typically happens when application is moving to background.
If app is moving back to foreground (becoming visible to user)
service destroys notification and also stop being foreground service.

If true service will create notification and will stay in foreground at all times.
