## Submitting issues

All new issues should follow instructions in [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
A properly filled issue report will significantly reduce number of follow up questions and decrease issue resolving time.
Most issues cannot be resolved without debug logs. Please try to isolate debug lines related to your issue.
Instructions for how to prepare debug logs can be found in section [Debugging](#debugging).
If you're reporting an app crash, debug logs might not contain all the necessary information about the cause of the crash.
In that case, also provide relevant parts of output of `adb logcat` command.

# Android background service issues
There are repeatedly reported issues with some android devices not working in the background. Check if your device model is on  [dontkillmyapp list](https://dontkillmyapp.com) before you report new issue. For more information check out [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com/problem).

## Description

Cross-platform geolocation for Cordova / PhoneGap with battery-saving "circular region monitoring" and "stop detection".

This plugin can be used for geolocation when the app is running in the foreground or background. It is more battery and data efficient than html5 geolocation or cordova-geolocation plugin. It can be used side by side with other geolocation providers (eg. html5 navigator.geolocation).

You can choose from two location location providers:
* **DISTANCE_FILTER_PROVIDER**
* **ACTIVITY_PROVIDER**
* **RAW_PROVIDER**

See [Which provider should I use?](/PROVIDERS.md) for more information about providers.

## Example Application

Checkout repository [cordova-plugin-background-geolocation-example](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation-example).

## Migrations

See [MIGRATIONS.md](/MIGRATIONS.md)

## Installing the plugin

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mauron85-background-geolocation
```

You may also want to change default iOS permission prompts and set specific google play version and android support library version for compatibility with other plugins.

**Note:** Always consult documentation of other plugins to figure out compatible versions.

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mauron85-background-geolocation \
  --variable GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION=11+ \
  --variable ANDROID_SUPPORT_LIBRARY_VERSION=23+ \
  --variable ALWAYS_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="App requires ..." \
  --variable MOTION_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="App requires motion detection"
```

Or in `config.xml`:

```
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-mauron85-background-geolocation">
  <variable name="GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION" value="11+" />
  <variable name="ANDROID_SUPPORT_LIBRARY_VERSION" value="23+" />
  <variable name="ALWAYS_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="App requires background tracking enabled" />
  <variable name="MOTION_USAGE_DESCRIPTION" value="App requires motion detection" />
</plugin>
```

**Note:** To apply changes, you must remove and reinstall plugin.


## Registering plugin for Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build

This plugin should work with Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build without any modification.
To register plugin add following line into your `config.xml`:

```
<plugin name="cordova-plugin-mauron85-background-geolocation"/>
```

**Note:** If you're using *hydration*, you have to download and reinstall your app with every new version of the plugin, as plugins are not updated.

## Compilation

### Compatibility

| Plugin version   | Cordova CLI       | Cordova Platform Android | Cordova Platform iOS |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| <2.3.0           | 6.4.0             | 6.3.0                    | 4.4.0                |
| >=2.3.0          | 7.1.0             | 6.3.0                    | 4.4.0                |

**Please note** that as of Cordova Android 6.0.0 icons are by default in mipmap/ directory not drawable/ directory, so this plugin will have a build issue on < 6.0.0 Cordova builds, you will need to update Authenticator.xml to drawable directory from mipmap directory to work on older versions.

### Android
You will need to ensure that you have installed the following items through the Android SDK Manager:

| Name                       | Version |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Android SDK Tools          | 26.0.2  |
| Android SDK Platform-tools | 26.0.2  |
| Android SDK Build-tools    | 26.0.2  |
| Android Support Repository | 47      |
| Android Support Library    | 26.1.0  |
| Google Play Services       | 11.8.0  |
| Google Repository          | 58      |

Android is no longer supporting downloading support libraries through the SDK Manager.
The support libraries are now available through Google's Maven repository.

    // Here we can decide whether we want stop the updates or not.
    // If you've configured the server to return 285, then it means the server does not require further update.
    // So the normal thing to do here would be to `BackgroundGeolocation.stop()`.
    // But you might be counting on it to receive location updates in the UI, so you could just reconfigure and set `url` to null.
  });

  BackgroundGeolocation.on('http_authorization', () => {

  });

  BackgroundGeolocation.checkStatus(function(status) {

    // you don't need to check status before start (this is just the example)
    if (!status.isRunning) {
      BackgroundGeolocation.start(); //triggers start on start event
    }
  });

  // you can also just start without checking for status
  // BackgroundGeolocation.start();

  // Don't forget to remove listeners at some point!
  // BackgroundGeolocation.removeAllListeners();

Partial reconfiguration is possible by later providing a subset of the configuration options:

```
BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
  debug: true
});
```

In this case new configuration options will be merged with stored configuration options and changes will be applied immediately.

**Important:** Because configuration options are applied partially, it's not possible to reset option to default value just by emitting it's key name and calling `configure` method. To reset configuration option to the default value, it's key must be set to `null`!

```
// Example: reset postTemplate to default
BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
  postTemplate: null
});
```

### getConfig(success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Get current configuration. Method will return all configuration options and their values in success callback.
Because `configure` method can be called with subset of the configuration options only,
`getConfig` method can be used to check the actual applied configuration.

```
BackgroundGeolocation.getConfig(function(config) {
  console.log(config);
});
```

### start()
Platform: iOS, Android

Start background geolocation.

### stop()
Platform: iOS, Android

| 2     | LOCATION_UNAVAILABLE | Internal source of location returned an internal error                   |
| 3     | TIMEOUT              | Timeout defined by `option.timeout was exceeded                          |

### isLocationEnabled(success, fail)
Deprecated: This method is deprecated and will be removed in next major version.
Use `checkStatus` as replacement.

Platform: iOS, Android

One time check for status of location services. In case of error, fail callback will be executed.

| Success callback parameter | Type      | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`                  | `Boolean` | true/false (true when location services are enabled) |

### checkStatus(success, fail)

Check status of the service

| Success callback parameter | Type      | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|

| `locationServicesEnabled`  | `Boolean` | true/false (true if location services are enabled)   |
| `authorization`            | `Number`  | authorization status                                 |

Authorization statuses:

* NOT_AUTHORIZED
* AUTHORIZED - authorization to run in background and foreground
* AUTHORIZED_FOREGROUND iOS only authorization to run in foreground only

Note: In the Android concept of authorization, these represent application permissions.

### showAppSettings()
Platform: Android >= 6, iOS >= 8.0

Show app settings to allow change of app location permissions.

### showLocationSettings()
Platform: Android

Show system settings to allow configuration of current location sources.

### getLocations(success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Method will return all stored locations.
This method is useful for initial rendering of user location on a map just after application launch.

| Success callback parameter | Type    | Description                    |
|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `locations`                | `Array` | collection of stored locations |

```javascript
BackgroundGeolocation.getLocations(
  function (locations) {
    console.log(locations);
  }
);
```

### getValidLocations(success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Method will return locations which have not yet been posted to server.

| Success callback parameter | Type    | Description                    |
|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `locations`                | `Array` | collection of stored locations |

### deleteLocation(locationId, success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Delete location with locationId.

### deleteAllLocations(success, fail)

**Note:** You don't need to delete all locations. The plugin manages the number of stored locations automatically and the total count never exceeds the number as defined by `option.maxLocations`.

Platform: iOS, Android

Delete all stored locations.

**Note:** Locations are not actually deleted from database to avoid gaps in locationId numbering.
Instead locations are marked as deleted. Locations marked as deleted will not appear in output of `BackgroundGeolocation.getValidLocations`.

### switchMode(modeId, success, fail)
Platform: iOS

Normally the plugin will handle switching between **BACKGROUND** and **FOREGROUND** mode itself.
Calling switchMode you can override plugin behavior and force it to switch into other mode.

In **FOREGROUND** mode the plugin uses iOS local manager to receive locations and behavior is affected
by `option.desiredAccuracy` and `option.distanceFilter`.

In **BACKGROUND** mode plugin uses significant changes and region monitoring to receive locations
and uses `option.stationaryRadius` only.

```
// switch to FOREGROUND mode
BackgroundGeolocation.switchMode(BackgroundGeolocation.FOREGROUND_MODE);

// switch to BACKGROUND mode
BackgroundGeolocation.switchMode(BackgroundGeolocation.BACKGROUND_MODE);
```

### forceSync()
Platform: Android, iOS

Force sync of pending locations. Option `syncThreshold` will be ignored and
all pending locations will be immediately posted to `syncUrl` in single batch.

### getLogEntries(limit, fromId, minLevel, success, fail)
Platform: Android, iOS

Return all logged events. Useful for plugin debugging.

| Parameter  | Type          | Description                                                                                       |

| `fromId`   | `Number`      | return entries after fromId. Useful if you plan to implement infinite log scrolling*              |
| `minLevel` | `String`      | return log entries above level. Available levels: ["TRACE", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR]      |
| `success`  | `Function`    | callback function which will be called with log entries                                           |

### Location event
| Location parameter     | Type      | Description                                                            |
|------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                   | `Number`  | ID of location as stored in DB (or null)                               |
| `provider`             | `String`  | gps, network, passive or fused                                         |
| `locationProvider`     | `Number`  | location provider                                                      |
| `time`                 | `Number`  | UTC time of this fix, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.           |
| `latitude`             | `Number`  | Latitude, in degrees.                                                  |
| `longitude`            | `Number`  | Longitude, in degrees.                                                 |
| `accuracy`             | `Number`  | Estimated accuracy of this location, in meters.                        |
| `speed`                | `Number`  | Speed if it is available, in meters/second over ground.                |
| `altitude`             | `Number`  | Altitude if available, in meters above the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid. |
| `bearing`              | `Number`  | Bearing, in degrees.                                                   |

| `mockLocationsEnabled` | `Boolean` | (android only) True if device has mock locations enabled               |

Locations parameters `isFromMockProvider` and `mockLocationsEnabled` are not posted to `url` or `syncUrl` by default.
Both can be requested via option `postTemplate`.

Note: Do not use location `id` as unique key in your database as ids will be reused when `option.maxLocations` is reached.

### Activity event
| Activity parameter | Type      | Description                                                            |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `confidence`       | `Number`  | Percentage indicating the likelihood user is performing this activity. |
| `type`             | `String`  | "IN_VEHICLE", "ON_BICYCLE", "ON_FOOT", "RUNNING", "STILL",             |
|                    |           | "TILTING", "UNKNOWN", "WALKING"                                        |


Event listeners can registered with:

```
const eventSubscription = BackgroundGeolocation.on('event', callbackFn);
```

And unregistered:

```
eventSubscription.remove();
```


**Note:** Components should unregister all event listeners in `componentWillUnmount` method,
individually, or with `removeAllListeners`

## HTTP locations posting

All locations updates are recorded in the local db at all times. When the App is in foreground or background, in addition to storing location in local db,
the location callback function is triggered. The number of locations stored in db is limited by `option.maxLocations` and never exceeds this number.
Instead, old locations are replaced by new ones.

When `option.url` is defined, each location is also immediately posted to url defined by `option.url`.
If the post is successful, the location is marked as deleted in local db.

When `option.syncUrl` is defined, all locations that fail to post locations will be coalesced and sent in some time later in a one single batch.
Batch sync takes place only when the number of failed-to-post locations reaches `option.syncTreshold`.
Locations are sent only in single batch, when the number of locations reaches `option.syncTreshold`. (No individual locations will be sent)

The request body of posted locations is always an array, even when only one location is sent.

Warning: `option.maxLocations` has to be larger than `option.syncThreshold`. It's recommended to be 2x larger. In any other case the location syncing might not work properly.

## Custom post template

With `option.postTemplate` it is possible to specify which location properties should be posted to `option.url` or `option.syncUrl`. This can be useful to reduce
the number of bytes sent "over the wire".

All wanted location properties have to be prefixed with `@`. For all available properties check [Location event](#location-event).

Two forms are supported:

**jsonObject**

```
BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
  postTemplate: {
    lat: '@latitude',
    lon: '@longitude',
    foo: 'bar' // you can also add your own properties
  }
});
```

**jsonArray**
```
BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
  postTemplate: ['@latitude', '@longitude', 'foo', 'bar']
});
```

Note: Keep in mind that all locations (even a single one) will be sent as an array of object(s), when postTemplate is `jsonObject` and array of array(s) for `jsonArray`!

### Android Headless Task (Experimental)

A special task that gets executed when the app is terminated, but the plugin was configured to continue running in the background (option `stopOnTerminate: false`).
In this scenario the [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html)
was killed by the system and all registered event listeners will not be triggered until the app is relaunched.

**Note:** Prefer configuration options `url` and `syncUrl` over headless task. Use it sparingly!

#### Task event
| Parameter          | Type      | Description                                                            |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `event.name`       | `String`  | Name of the event [ "location", "stationary", "activity" ]             |
| `event.params`     | `Object`  | Event parameters. @see [Events](#events)                               |

Keep in mind that the callback function lives in an isolated scope. Variables from a higher scope cannot be referenced!

Following example requires [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) enabled backend server.

```
BackgroundGeolocation.headlessTask(function(event) {
    if (event.name === 'location' ||
      event.name === 'stationary') {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open('POST', 'http://192.168.81.14:3000/headless');
        xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        xhr.send(JSON.stringify(event.params));
    }

    return 'Processing event: ' + event.name; // will be logged
});
```

### Example of backend server

[Background-geolocation-server](https://github.com/mauron85/background-geolocation-server) is a backend server written in nodejs
with CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support.
There are instructions how to run it and simulate locations on Android, iOS Simulator and Genymotion.

## Quirks

### iOS

On iOS the plugin will execute your registered `.on('location', callbackFn)` callback function. You may manually POST the received ```Geolocation``` to your server using standard XHR. However for long running tasks, you need
to wrap your code in `startTask` - `endTask` block.

#### `stationaryRadius` (apply only for DISTANCE_FILTER_PROVIDER)

The plugin uses iOS Significant Changes API, and starts triggering ```callbackFn``` only when a cell-tower switch is detected (i.e. the device exits stationary radius). The function ```switchMode``` is provided to force the plugin to enter "BACKGROUND" stationary or "FOREGROUND" mode.

Plugin cannot detect the exact moment the device moves out of the stationary-radius.  In normal conditions, it can take as much as 3 city-blocks to 1/2 km before stationary-region exit is detected.

### Android

On Android devices it is recommended to have a notification in the drawer (option `startForeground:true`). This gives plugin location service higher priority, decreasing probability of OS killing it. Check [wiki](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation/wiki/Android-implementation) for explanation.

#### Custom ROMs

Plugin should work with custom ROMS at least DISTANCE_FILTER_PROVIDER. But ACTIVITY_PROVIDER provider depends on Google Play Services.
Usually ROMs don't include Google Play Services libraries. Strange bugs may occur, like no GPS locations (only from network and passive) and other. When posting issue report, please mention that you're using custom ROM.

#### Multidex

**Note:** Following section was kindly copied from [phonegap-plugin-push](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md#multidex). Visit link for resolving issue with facebook plugin.

If you have an issue compiling the app and you're getting an error similar to this (`com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define`):

```
UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION:
com.android.dex.DexException: Multiple dex files define Landroid/support/annotation/AnimRes;

  at com.android.dx.command.Main.main(Main.java:106)
```

Then at least one other plugin you have installed is using an outdated way to declare dependencies such as `android-support` or `play-services-gcm`.
This causes gradle to fail, and you'll need to identify which plugin is causing it and request an update to the plugin author, so that it uses the proper way to declare dependencies for cordova.
See [this for the reference on the cordova plugin specification](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.4.0/plugin_ref/spec.html#link-18), it'll be usefull to mention it when creating an issue or requesting that plugin to be updated.

Common plugins to suffer from this outdated dependency management are plugins related to *facebook*, *google+*, *notifications*, *crosswalk* and *google maps*.

#### Android Permissions

Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" introduced a new permissions model where the user can turn on and off permissions as necessary. When user disallow location access permissions, error configure callback will be called with error code: 2.


#### Notification icons

**Note:** Only available for API Level >=21.

To use custom notification icons, you need to put icons into *res/drawable* directory **of your app**. You can automate the process  as part of **after_platform_add** hook configured via [config.xml](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation-example/blob/master/config.xml). Check [config.xml](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation-example/blob/master/config.xml) and [scripts/res_android.js](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation-example/blob/master/scripts/res_android.js) of example app for reference.

If you only want a single large icon, set `notificationIconLarge` to null and include your icon's filename in the `notificationIconSmall` parameter.

With Adobe® PhoneGap™ Build icons must be placed into ```locales/android/drawable``` dir at the root of your project. For more information go to [how-to-add-native-image-with-phonegap-build](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30802589/how-to-add-native-image-with-phonegap-build/33221780#33221780).

### Intel XDK

Plugin will not work in XDK emulator ('Unimplemented API Emulation: BackgroundGeolocation.start' in emulator). But will work on real device.

## Debugging

See [DEBUGGING.md](/DEBUGGING.md)

## Geofencing
There is nice cordova plugin [cordova-plugin-geofence](https://github.com/cowbell/cordova-plugin-geofence), which does exactly that. Let's keep this plugin lightweight as much as possible.
